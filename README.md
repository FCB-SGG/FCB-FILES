Fcb products published by SGG.(Xiaohong Zhang，Fei Guo，Pan Li，Jiahuan Hu)

Users can use FCB products to get  ambiguity-fixed solutions in Precise Point Positioning. 
The FCBs are corresponding to P1, P2, L1 and L2. The C1 code can be used after taking the P1C1 DCB corrections.  P1/P2 code should be used as it is, that is, no P1P2 DCB corrections needed.
